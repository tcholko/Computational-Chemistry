Here are a small sample of scripts to analyze molecular dynamics and Brownian dynamics trajectories. Among other things, these can be used to calculate
electrostatic or vdw (LJ) intermolecular interactions, diffusion coefficients, molecular radial distribution functions, binding pathways and molecular
association rates.
